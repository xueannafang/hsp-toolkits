# HSP-toolkits (v1.0)

* *Solvent Predictor*: Based on the target Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs), propose a list of multi-solvent combination.
* *M Locator*: Predict HSPs of the studied material based on a solubility score.

Experimental test data is contributed by the CMP team of the Faul research group.

## General Info

**version 1.0**
-This version is designed for non-coding users.
-Microsoft Excel is required to be installed for input/output.
-Both toolkits are developed with Python 3.7.3 and tested in the operating system of Windows 10.




## *Solvent Predictor*
Given that HSP of a solvent mixture follows a linear combination of each individual component, researchers can easily calculate the HSP of solvent systems with known components. It is however much more difficult to reverse this process.

With *Solvent Predictor*, a set of HSP can be converted into a multi-solvent list based on the requirement of user.
