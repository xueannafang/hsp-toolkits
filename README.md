This project contains two python-based Hansen solubility parameters (HSP) toolkits:

* [*Solvent Predictor* (v 1.0)](https://github.com/xueannafang/hsp-toolkits/blob/main/HSP_SolventPredictor/solv_pred_readme.md)
(Last updated on 06/11/2022)
Based on the target Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs), propose a list of multi-solvent combination.

* [*M Locator* (v 1.0)]
(Last updated on 01/11/2022)
Predict HSPs of the studied material based on an experimental-measurable solubility score.

These toolkits are developed with Python 3.7.3 and tested in Windows 10.
