## General Info

-These toolkits are developed with Python 3.7.3 and tested in the operating system of Windows 10.

-This version is designed for users with less coding experience.

-Microsoft Excel is required to be installed for input/output.

-Python 3.7 and Jupyter Notebook is required to be installed.



## *Solvent Predictor*

Given that HSP of a solvent mixture follows a linear combination of each individual component, researchers can easily calculate the HSP of solvent systems with known components. It is however much more difficult to reverse this process.

The aim of *Solvent Predictor* is to support the solvent suggestion when a desired goal of HSP is known.

The key function is to convert the target HSP into a multi-solvent list based on the requirement of user.
