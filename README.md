## General Info
This toolkit contains two parts:
* *SolvPredictor* is to reverse predicting solvent combinations based on a given set of Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs).
* *MLocator* is to predict HSPs of the studied material based on its characteristic UV-Vis absorbance in a series of solvents.

## Technologies
This project is created with Python 3.7.3
