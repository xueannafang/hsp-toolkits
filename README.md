# HSP-toolkits (v1.0)

* *Solvent Predictor*: Based on the target Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs), propose a list of multi-solvent combination.
* *M Locator*: Predict HSPs of the studied material based on a solubility score, for example, characteristic UV-Vis absorbance in a series of solvents.

## General Info

Both toolkits are developed with Python 3.7.3 and tested in Windows 10
Microsoft Excel is required to be installed for input/output

This project is developed by
- Xue Fang (School of chemistry, University of Bristol, UK)
- Bo Gao (School of physics, University of Bristol, UK)

with guidance from
- Prof. Charl FJ Faul (School of chemistry, University of Bristol, UK)
- Dr Natalie Fey (School of chemistry, University of Bristol, UK)
- Dr Ella Gale (School of chemistry, University of Bristol, UK)

Experimental test data is contributed by the CMP team of the Faul research group.
