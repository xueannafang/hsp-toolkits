# M Locator

*M Locator* is a top-down approach to aiming at obtaining the HSP of as-studied material using a solubility indicator in a series of solvents.

The solubility indicator applied in this version is based on UV-Vis spectroscoy features.

The studied materials in this case are based on conjugated microporous polymers (CMP).
